# SmartCity

A smart city uses modern technology to improve everyday life, make things more efficient, and protect the environment. It focuses on smart solutions to solve urban problems and make cities better places to live.


## Key Elements of a Smart City

1. Waste to Energy Plants:
These plants turn waste into energy. Instead of throwing waste in landfills, it is burned or processed to generate electricity or heat, which helps reduce pollution and provides power to the city

2. Solar Farms:
Solar farms use sunlight to produce clean energy through solar panels. This renewable energy helps power homes and businesses without polluting the environment.

3. Smart Water Management:
This system uses technology to monitor water use, find leaks, and manage supply efficiently. It helps save water, reduce waste, and ensure everyone has access to clean water

4. Smart Traffic Management:
   Smart traffic systems use sensors and data to control traffic lights and monitor road conditions. This helps reduce traffic jams, saves time, and cuts down on pollution.

6. Smart Waste Management:
   Waste bins and collection trucks are fitted with sensors to know when they’re full. This system helps collect waste more efficiently, reduce unnecessary trips, and improve recycling efforts.
